🤔 Good question! Aside from a place to infrequently blog, for many years I've wanted a website to record places I've been. I think it's nice to be able to look back at the end of the year and reflect on the things you've done and places you've been throughout the year! I plan to have a bullet list style but write up a review/reflection on places or things I really enjoyed.
